The main class for this beta is in BattleMain.java.

The functionality implemented thus far is as follows:
-----------------------------------------------------
*Player vs. Player mode only (same machine)
   * Interfaces and Architecture will make Player vs. Computer and networked modes easy
*Graphical User Interface (Swing)
*Full game functionality
   *Placing ships from arbitrary rule deck, auto-validating ship placements
   *Prompting each player in turn for moves
   *Ascertaining the result of each move, and updating both views accordingly
   *Full-featured message-passing framework (in-line text (info, warning, error, etc..) and popups)
   *Automatic determination of when the game ends, and who won.
*MVC Architecture, all interfaces implemented.

Still to come
-------------
*PVC and PVP Networked mode
   *Different Computer Strategies (Difficulty Levels)
*Menu (for resetting score, new game, changing player names, etc..)
*Novel gameplay modes (>2 Players, etc..)
*Different icon sets
*Save/Replay game?  (but who wants to watch Battleship?)
*Rework message passing to allow scrollable message area (to pass multiple pieces of info at the same time)
*Code Cleanup, Javadoc, ...
