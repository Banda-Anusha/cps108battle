Due: 10/22/07


The main class for this beta is in BattleMain.java.

The functionality implemented thus far is as follows:
-----------------------------------------------------
*Any combination of 2 players (can be AI or Human)
   * Interfaces and Architecture will make networked mode easy
*Graphical User Interface (Swing)
*Full game functionality
   *Placing ships from arbitrary rule deck, auto-validating ship placements
   *Prompting each player in turn for moves
   *Ascertaining the result of each move, and updating both views accordingly
   *Full-featured message-passing framework (in-line text (info, warning, error, etc..) and popups)
   *Automatic determination of when the game ends, and who won.
   *Full support for arbitrary-sized rectangular boards and arbitrary number, name, and shape (not just length) of ships
   *2-Click ship placement for linear ships (origin and direction)
*MVC Architecture, all interfaces implemented.

Still to come
-------------
*PVP Networked mode
   *Different Computer Strategies (Difficulty Levels)
*Novel gameplay modes (>2 Players, etc..)
*Different icon sets
*Save/Replay game?  (but who wants to watch Battleship?)
*Rework message passing to allow scrollable message area (to pass multiple pieces of info at the same time)
*Code Cleanup, Javadoc, ...


How to run
----------
Give it 2 command-line arguments: the first one should be "h" for human, and "c" for computer, and likewise for the second argument.
For example, "java BattleMain c h" will pit an AI Player 1 against a human Player 2.
